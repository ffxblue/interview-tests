title:  WordPress Metabox

## Summary

The purpose of this exercise is for us to get a sense of how you would approach designing and implementing a simple WordPress integration before we get you in for an interview. We're avoiding tricky algorithmic tests in favor of something that shows how you approach problems and organise a codebase.

There is no time limit for this test, but we expect most applicants to complete the requirements in roughly 3-4 hours.

If you make any assumptions about requirements, or use any online resources to solve a problem, please make note of these in your code comments.

Your solution will be evaluated internally by your potential co-workers. You should expect a response from us within two business days.
